Data and code necessary to reproduce the findings of the paper Dietzel et al. 2020:
"Long-term shifts in the colony size structure of coral populations along the Great Barrier Reef"
Proceedings of the Royal Society B doi:10.1098/rspb.2020.1432rspb20201432


The R project file "Colony_Size_Structure.Rproj" sets the working directory.

All R scripts are stored in the subfolder "R", all data in subfolder "data". Please note raw intercept data are not deposited here but 
stored alongside R code on Datadryad (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.ncjsxksrq)

The file "Change_absolute.R" executes the analysis of changes in size-class abundances.

The file "Change_relative.R" executes the analysis of shifts in the mean, standard deviation, 10th and 90th percentile of colony size.
